`astsa` is the R package to accompany the [Springer](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319524511) text, [Time Series Analysis and Its Applications: With R Examples](http://www.stat.pitt.edu/stoffer/tsa4/) 
and forthcoming Chapman & Hall text (summer 2019) [Time Series A Data Analysis Approach using R](http://www.stat.pitt.edu/stoffer/tsda/)... both by Shumway and Stoffer.  We're updating the package for the new text, but the Springer text was written under version 1.8, so you can get through that text with the CRAN version.

I won't always push the latest version of the package to CRAN because sometimes it's a pain working with those people.  Consequently, the latest working version of the package will always be here. 
 

* Version 1.8.5 on GitHub
* Version 1.8 on CRAN (Springer text written under this version)
* At this point there are only minor differences between the versions. 
* See the [News](https://github.com/nickpoison/astsa/blob/master/NEWS.md) for further details about the state of the package and the changelog.
