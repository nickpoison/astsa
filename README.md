`astsa` is the R package to accompany the [Springer](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319524511) text, [Time Series Analysis and Its Applications: With R Examples](http://www.stat.pitt.edu/stoffer/tsa4/)  and the Chapman & Hall text  [Time Series A Data Analysis Approach using R](http://www.stat.pitt.edu/stoffer/tsda/)... both by Shumway and Stoffer. 

**Feel free to contact me if you have a request. The requests I've had so far have taken only a few minutes to code - it's the nice thing about GitHub - updates are painless.**

The Springer text was written under version 1.8 and the Chapman & Hall text was written under version 1.8.8. Later versions will work for both texts with only some minor changes that won't affect any of the data analysis. 

<s>
I won't always push the latest version of the package to CRAN because sometimes it's a pain working with those people.</s> It looks like CRAN package processing is completely automated now... YES! We'll no longer be subjected to the whims of some CRANks.  I might start updating 
the package on CRAN more often now, but the latest working version of the package will always be here.
 
* Versions 1.10+ on GitHub and CRAN 
* See the [News](https://github.com/nickpoison/astsa/blob/master/NEWS.md) for further details about the state of the package and the changelog.
