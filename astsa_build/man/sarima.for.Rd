\usage{
sarima.for(xdata,n.ahead,p,d,q,P=0,D=0,Q=0,S=-1,tol = sqrt(.Machine$double.eps),
         no.constant = FALSE, plot = TRUE, plot.all = FALSE,
         xreg = NULL, newxreg = NULL, fixed = NULL, data = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{xdata}{univariate time series
}
  \item{n.ahead}{forecast horizon (number of periods)
}
  \item{p}{AR order
}
  \item{d}{difference order
}
  \item{q}{MA order
}
  \item{P}{SAR order; use only for seasonal models 
}
  \item{D}{seasonal difference; use only for seasonal models
}
  \item{Q}{SMA order; use only for seasonal models
}
  \item{S}{seasonal period; use only for seasonal models 
}
  \item{tol}{controls the relative tolerance (reltol) used to assess convergence. The default is \code{sqrt(.Machine$double.eps)}, the R default.
}
  \item{no.constant}{controls whether or not a constant is included in the model. If \code{no.constant=TRUE}, no constant is included in the model.
   See  \code{\link{sarima}} for more details.
}
  \item{plot}{if TRUE (default) the data (or some of it) and the forecasts and bounds are plotted
}  
  \item{plot.all}{if TRUE, all the data are plotted in the graphic; otherwise, only the last 100 observations are plotted in the graphic.
}
  \item{xreg}{Optionally, a vector or matrix of external regressors, which must have the same number of rows as the series. If this is used, \code{newxreg} MUST be specified.
}
  \item{newxreg}{New values of \code{xreg} to be used for prediction. Must have at least \code{n.ahead} rows.
}
  \item{fixed}{optional numeric vector of the same length as the total number of parameters. If supplied, only parameters corresponding to NA entries will be estimated. 
}
  \item{data}{an optional (may be multiple) time series (ts) object; useful if using \code{xreg}.
}
  \item{...}{additional graphical arguments
}
}
\details{For example, \code{sarima.for(x,5,1,0,1)} will forecast five time points ahead for an ARMA(1,1) fit to x. The output prints the forecasts and the standard errors of the forecasts, and supplies a graphic of the forecast with +/- 1 and 2 prediction error bounds.
