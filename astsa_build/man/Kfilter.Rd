Quick Kalman Filter 
} 
\description{
Returns both the predicted and filtered values for various linear  state space models;
it also evaluates the likelihood at the given parameter values.
This script replaces \code{Kfilter0}, \code{Kfilter1}, and \code{Kfilter2} 
}
\usage{
Kfilter(y, A, mu0, Sigma0, Phi, sQ, sR, Ups = NULL, Gam = NULL, 
         input = NULL, S = NULL, version = 1)
}
\arguments{
  \item{y}{
data matrix (n \code{x} q), vector or time series, n = number of observations.
Use \code{NA} or  zero (0) for missing data.
}
  \item{A}{
can be constant or an array with dimension \code{dim=c(q,p,n)} if time varying (see details).
Use \code{NA} or  zero (0) for missing data.
}
  \item{mu0}{
initial state mean vector (p \code{x} 1)
}
  \item{Sigma0}{
initial state covariance matrix (p \code{x} p)
}
  \item{Phi}{
state transition matrix (p \code{x} p)
}
  \item{sQ}{
state error pre-matrix (see details)
}
  \item{sR}{
observation error pre-matrix (see details)
}
  \item{Ups}{
state input matrix (p \code{x} r); leave as NULL (default) if not needed
}
  \item{Gam}{
observation input matrix (q \code{x} r); leave as NULL (default) if not needed
}
  \item{input}{
NULL (default) if not needed or a   
matrix (n \code{x} r) of inputs having the same row dimension (n) as y
}
  \item{S}{
covariance matrix between the (not premultiplied) state and observation errors; not necessary to specify if not needed and only used if version=2. See details for more information.
}
  \item{version}{
either 1 (default) or 2; version 2 allows for correlated errors
}

\details{This script replaces \code{Kfilter0}, \code{Kfilter1}, and \code{Kfilter2} by combining all
cases. The major difference is how to specify the covariance matrices; in particular, 
\code{sQ = t(cQ)} and \code{sR = t(cR)} where \code{cQ} and \code{cR} were used in \code{Kfilter0-1-2} scripts.

The states \eqn{x_t} are p-dimensional, the data \eqn{y_t} are q-dimensional, and 
the inputs \eqn{u_t} are r-dimensional for \eqn{t=1, \dots, n}. The initial state is \eqn{x_0 \sim N(\mu_0, \Sigma_0)}.

The measurement matrices \eqn{A_t} can be constant or time varying.  If   time varying, they should be entered as an array of dimension \code{dim = c(q,p,n)}.  Otherwise, just enter the constant value making sure it has the appropriate \eqn{q \times p} dimension.

Version 1 (default): The general model  is 
\deqn{x_t = \Phi  x_{t-1} + \Upsilon u_{t} +   sQ\,  w_t \quad w_t \sim iid\ N(0,I)}
\deqn{y_t = A_t  x_{t-1} + \Gamma u_{t} +   sR\, v_t \quad v_t \sim iid\ N(0,I)}
where \eqn{w_t \perp v_t}. Consequently the state noise covariance matrix is
\eqn{Q = sQ\, sQ'} and the observation noise covariance matrix is
\eqn{R = sR\, sR'} and \eqn{sQ, sR}  do not have to be square as long as everything is
conformable.  Notice the specification of the state and observation covariances has changed from the original scripts.

\emph{NOTE:} If it is easier to model in terms of \eqn{Q} and \eqn{R}, simply input the square root matrices
\code{sQ = Q \%^\% .5} and \code{sR = R \%^\% .5}.

Version 2 (correlated errors): The general model  is
\deqn{x_{t+1} = \Phi  x_{t} + \Upsilon u_{t+1} +   sQ\,  w_t \quad w_t \sim iid\ N(0,I)}
\deqn{y_t = A_t  x_{t-1} + \Gamma u_{t} +   sR\, v_t \quad v_t \sim iid\ N(0,I)}
where \eqn{S = {\rm Cov}(w_t, v_t)}, and NOT  \eqn{ {\rm Cov}(sQ\, w_t, sR\, v_t)}.

\emph{NOTE:}   If it is easier to model in terms of \eqn{Q} and \eqn{R}, simply input the square root matrices
\code{sQ = Q \%^\% .5} and \code{sR = R \%^\% .5}.


Note that in either version, \eqn{sQ\, w_t}  has to be p-dimensional, but  \eqn{w_t} does not, and
 \eqn{sR\, v_t}  has to be q-dimensional, but  \eqn{v_t} does not.

\note{Note that \code{Kfilter} is similar to \code{Kfilter-0-1-2} except that only the essential values need to be entered (and come first in the statement); the optional values such as 
   \code{input} are set to \code{NULL} by default if they are not needed. This version is faster
   than the older versions. The biggest change was to how the covarainces are specified. For example, if you have code that used \code{Kfilter1}, just use \code{sQ = t(cQ)} and \code{sR = t(cR)} here.
   
NOTE: If it is easier to model in terms of \eqn{Q} and \eqn{R}, simply input the square root matrices
\code{sQ = Q\%^\%.5} and \code{sR = R\%^\%.5}.
