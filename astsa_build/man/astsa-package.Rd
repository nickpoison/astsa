} 
\description{
Contains data sets and scripts for analyzing time series in both the frequency and time domains including state space modeling as well as supporting the texts \href{https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-70584-7}{Time Series Analysis and Its Applications: With R Examples (5th ed, 2025)}  and \href{https://www.routledge.com/Time-Series-A-Data-Analysis-Approach-Using-R/Shumway-Stoffer/p/book/9781041031642}{Time Series: A Data Analysis Approach Using R, (2nd ed, 2026)}. Most scripts are designed to need minimal input to produce aesthetically pleasing output for ease of use in live demonstrations and in course work.

\section{Warning}{If loaded, the \code{dplyr} package corrupts the base scripts \code{filter} and \code{lag} among other things. In this case, whenever you analyze time series data, we suggest you either:

(1) Detach it if it's loaded but not being used: 
\preformatted{   detach(package:dplyr)
} 

(2) If you want to use it, fix it: 
\preformatted{
   library(dplyr, exclude = c("filter", "lag"))   # load it without the culprits 
   dlag    = dplyr::lag         # and fix ... 
   dfilter = dplyr::filter      # ... the blunders
}
then use \code{dlag} and \code{dfilter} for \code{dplyr} scripts \cr
and \code{lag} and \code{filter} can be use as originally intended.


(3) Or just take back the commands:
\preformatted{
   filter = stats::filter
   lag    = stats::lag 
}
and you can still use these for \code{dpylr}: 
\preformatted{
   dlag    = dplyr::lag
   dfilter = dplyr::filter
} 
}
