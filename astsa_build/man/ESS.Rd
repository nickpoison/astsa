\title{
Effective Sample Size (ESS)
} 
\description{
Estimates the ESS of a given vector of samples.
}
\usage{
ESS(trace, tol = 1e-08, BIC=TRUE))
}
\arguments{
  \item{trace}{
vector of sampled values from an MCMC run (univariate only)
}
  \item{tol}{
ESS is returned as zero if the estimated spectrum at frequency zero is less than this value
}
  \item{BIC}{
if TRUE (default), \code{spec0} is obtained using BIC;
otherwise, AIC is used.  See the details.
}
}
\details{
Uses \code{\link{spec.ic}} to estimate the spectrum of the input at frequency zero (\code{spec0}). Then, ESS is estimated as
\code{ESS = length(trace)*var(trace)/spec0}.  
}
\value{
Returns the estimated ESS of the input.
