\title{
Powers of a Square Matrix
}
\description{
\code{matrixpwr} computes powers of a square matrix including negative powers for nonsingular matrices.

\code{\%^\%} is a more intuitive interface as an operator.
} 
\usage{
matrixpwr(A, power)

A \%^\% power
}
\arguments{
  \item{A}{
a square matrix
}
  \item{power}{
single numeric
}
}
\details{
Raises matrix to the specified power. The matrix must be square
and if \code{power < 0}, the matrix must be nonsingular.

Note that \code{\%^\%} is defined as
\code{"\%^\%" <- function(A, power) matrixpwr(A, power) }

If \code{power = 0}, the identity matrix is returned.
}
\value{
Returns matrix raised to the given power.
