Spectral Envelope
} 
\description{
Computes the spectral envelope of categorical-valued or real-valued time series.
}
\usage{
specenv(xdata, section = NULL, spans = NULL, kernel = NULL, taper = 0,
         significance = 1e-04, plot = TRUE, ylim = NULL, real = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{xdata}{For categorical-valued sequences, a matrix with rows that are indicators
of the categories represented by the columns, possibly a sequence converted using
\code{\link{dna2vector}}.  For real-valued sequences, a matrix with at least two
columns that are various transformations of the data.
}
  \item{section}{
of the form \code{start:end} where \code{start < end} are positive integers;
specifies the section used in the analysis - default is the entire sequence.
}
  \item{spans}{
specify smoothing used in \code{mvspec}.
}
  \item{kernel}{
specify kernel to be used in \code{mvspec}.
}
  \item{taper}{
specify amount of tapering to be used in \code{mvspec}.
}
  \item{significance}{
significance threshold exhibited in plot - default is .0001; set to NA to cancel
}
  \item{plot}{
if TRUE (default) a graphic of the spectral envelope is produced
}
  \item{ylim}{
limits of the spectral envelope axis; if NULL (default), a suitable range is calculated.
}
  \item{real}{ FALSE (default) for categorical-valued sequences and TRUE for
real-valued sequences.
}
  \item{\dots}{
other graphical parameters.
}
}
\details{
Calculates the spectral envelope for categorical-valued series as discussed in \cr
     \kbd{https://www.stat.pitt.edu/stoffer/dss_files/spenv.pdf} \cr
     and summarized in \cr
      \kbd{https://doi.org/10.1214/ss/1009212816}. \cr
  Alternately, calculates the spectral envelope for real-valued series as discussed in \cr
   \kbd{https://doi.org/10.1016/S0378-3758(96)00044-4}.

These concepts are also presented (with examples) in Section 7.9 (Chapter 7) of  Time Series Analysis and Its Applications: With R Examples: \kbd{https://www.stat.pitt.edu/stoffer/tsa4/}.

For categorical-valued series, the input  \code{xdata} must be a matrix of indicators which is perhaps a sequence preprocessed using \code{\link{dna2vector}}.

For real-valued series, the input \code{xdata} should be a matrix whose columns are various transformations of the univariate series.

The script does not detrend the data prior to estimating spectra. If this is an issue, then detrend the data prior to using this script.

\value{
By default, will produce a graph of the spectral envelope and an approximate significance threshold.
A matrix containing: frequency, spectral envelope ordinates, and (1) the scalings of the categories in the order of the categories in the alphabet or (2) the coefficients of the transformations, is returned invisibly.
